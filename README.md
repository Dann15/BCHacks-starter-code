# BC Hacks Lite 2020 Github Workshop
> Presented by Developers Student Club UBC

<p>Welcome to our github workshop!
This repo contains code that will be used in the demos.
Please fork this repository so you can work alongside us :)</p>

## Prerequisites

<p>What you need to prepare before the demo:</p>

- Install Git and have a github account ready https://git-scm.com/
- Make sure you have access to your [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) through your gmail account.
- Install npm (node.js). https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
- Install firebase dev tools. https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#windows-npm `npm install -g firebase-tools`
- Have your favourite IDE or text editor handy

## The Code

<p>The code in this repository is a super simple webapp that fetches random
programming jokes from a RESTful API (https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) using
a jQuery ajax request.</p>

<p> Since this workshop isn't focused on the code itself, this webapp will
act as a sample for us to demo deployment later on.</p>

## The Workshop

<p>What we'll cover</p>

- The Basics:
  - What is git/github?
  - Common commands
  - Demo usage with this starter code
- Github Pages:
  - What is ghpages and what can you do with it?
  - Demo deploying a generic react template to github pages.
- Github Actions/Firebase
  - Automation with github actions
  - Deployment to Firebase
  
<p>We hope that through this workshop you'll learn about github/git basics, 
useful use cases, and how you can deploy your hackathon projects for collaboration
and presentations.</p>
